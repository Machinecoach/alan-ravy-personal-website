            <h3>Hard work pays off!</h3>
            <p>I am a huge fan of fitness and health. My favorite part of it is how if I put in the work each day, I can all but ensure progress. This lesson bleeds into other parts of my life and I am a better all around employee, husband, and father because of it.</p>

            <h3>I like to Skate!</h3>
            <p>When I was a kid, I loved skateboarding, but I stopped doing it as I got older.  Now I've picked it back up and I am 12 all over again!</p>

            <h3>I make a mean pourover!</h3>
            <p>I love coffee.  As a consultant, I spent a lot of time traveling to NYC and got spoiled with many great options.  Now, I have a Pavlovian response when I see people drinking coffee or even hear the word.  But I can stop anytime...</p>

            <h3>I am a Gamer!</h3>
            <p>Funny story. My aunt won a Sega Genesis when I was 4 years old from a fast-food peel off game and she gave it to me... The rest is history. I enjoy all games, but if I had to pick a genre it would be RPGs and brands I find consistently awesome are Nintendo and Blizzard Entertainment.</p>

          <a class="BUTTON_SRZ" href="mailto:alanravy@gmail.com">✉️ MESSAGE ME</a>
          <p class="contact-p">In my experience with massive scale enterprises, I have come across huge opportunities.  So huge in fact, that from where I sit, it was entirely unreasonable to NOT pursue them, even without perfect information. If you need someone who won't give up, who will roll up their sleeves, be scrappy and get it done no matter how abstract or crazy, I am totally in!</p>
